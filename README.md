# postchild

# Preface

Presumably everyone has used postman, an interface testing tool, to develop interfaces on weekdays, and should be familiar to him. Recently, I stumbled upon a web version of the interface testing tool, which is free and open source. Yes, it is [postwoman](https://postwoman.io/), a refreshing and handsome UI interface, powerful functions, and not inferior to postman, which makes me praise it.

# Motivation

For the purpose of learning, I also imitated and developed a simplified interface testing tool and named it [postchild](http://postchild.io).
Since it is the purpose of learning, in this project I will reduce the use of third-party libraries as much as possible, and try to rely on writing code to achieve it. In the process, it is also a kind of missing knowledge, especially my deficiencies in web communication and http protocol. The following will briefly introduce the technology stack used and the functions planned for the future.

# Technology stack

1. Vue
2. Nuxt
3. Axios
4. Travis CI

# Function list

- [x] Basic request GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH
- [x] History (implemented by vuex)
- [ ] WebSocket
- [ ] SocketIO
- [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] Interface theme color switch
- [ ] Authorized login (in order to store history and favorites)
- [ ] Favorites function

# Experience address

Finally, send the experience address: [http://postchild.io](http://postchild.io)
